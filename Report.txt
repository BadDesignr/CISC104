The intentions of project one was to make a simple count game where the player would be a cube.
 You could control the cube through wasd controls and would locate the sphere on the platform. Once running
into the sphere the Ball Count at the center of the platform would increase for each time the Cube and Sphere
Were to collide. The way it would work is that the coding for movement was a code that 
would get input from the different axises to have the cube move places. The actual 
collision manager was going to be similar to the week 4 if statement collision manager but using 
only one input instead of two. Unfortunately it didn't go all that well.
